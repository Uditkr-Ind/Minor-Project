# Minor-Project

Developed a microcontroller-driven Automatic Plant Irrigation System that identified soil moisture levels using a voltage 
comparator & aided by Arduino to irrigate the soil in which section the soil is lacking water content. Reduced water wastage
by up to 90% and improved crop production by up to 50%.
